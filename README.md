Udacity Front End Web Developer Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

This is a map for locally owned great restaurants as decided by me.
Upon load the full list of restaurants is present.
User can filter results via search to narrow list and markers down.
hovering over item in list highlights location on map with info window.
clicking on list item brings up foursquare information availablef for that location.
same is also true for map markers regarding hover and click.
